            <h2>CIRCE</h2>
            <img src='https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1522296139i/25288839._SX540_.jpg'>
            <p>Circe was a fairly frustrating read. Madeline Miller writes beautifully and with an almost musical pace that makes reading her words a pleasure. Her style reminds me of fairy-tales, and I love a good fairy-tale. Her material is also fairly fairy-tale-esque, as all Greek legends are. The tale Miller writes is fascinating: many stories and Greek myths intertwined with Circe’s own and Miller offers a brand-new interpretation of them all. As an added bonus, she writes with a feminist tilt that generated joy and feelings of female empowerment. Go bad ass witchy lady!  

                    However, I found this story emotionally flat. This makes sense since Miller writes the book as if it’s Circe’s memoir and all the events she write about are in the distant past (she’s immortal so the past is very much distant). So yes, it makes sense for the emotions to be faded but I do love me some angsty feelings and this book aint got that. 
                    
                    I also thought the plot dragged just a little bit. No mean feat when you consider that thousands of years were condensed into a mere 333 pages. I expected the book would be overflowing with adventures and legends and action. It was not. Even when there was an adventure the writing was sedate, the plot slow and there was an awful lot of Circe strolling forlornly around her island. It was a little like the endless scenes of Ross Poldark galloping dramatically across the Cornwall coast. Dramatic and intense? Yes. Boring? Y E S. This isn’t to say that the story wasn’t interesting or worth reading. It just means that nothing particular about Circe’s story stuck with me. I finished the book only a week ago and already I find it difficult to remember many key moments that struck me at the time.
                    
                    The one moment which does stay with me is the bit where Circe turns all the sailors who come to her island into pigs! I feel it is important to note that this came after she was attacked by a sailor and wasn’t just a random act of female villainy as the Odyssey would suggest. In this retelling it was a fierce and satisfying John Wick style retribution! Oh to have the power to turn people into pigs… not for any particular reason, I just think it would be a really cool (albeit creepy) party trick. 
                    
                    Overall, I did enjoy reading Circe even though the emotional dryness does keep this from entering my list of all-time favourites. But if you like Greek mythology or female empowerment or turning men into pigs (or all of the above) then definitely check out this book! And if you like kick ass witchy women then this book is essential for your reading list!
